How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Viewing the difference between two files helps to look only at the lines which
are changed hence findings the bug will be easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?
Having access to the entire historz helps to view how the file was developed 
over a period of time and also it is very helpful to restore the old version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: 
With manual commit the developer has control over when to commit.
It can be made sure that the difference between two commits is logical.
Not too many commits.
Cons:
Sometimes the uncommited changes are lost due to not savinf the file or accedentaly deleting file.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files 
in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google Docs version control system is made for documents where interdependency between documents is less.
Where as Git is used for code file where the interdependency between file is more.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log can be used to find the complete history and the description of each change.
By reading the descriptions it can be foundout which files are to be compared and using git diff
to find the difference between the files.
